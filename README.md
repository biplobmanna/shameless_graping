# Shameless Graping
A lightweight minimalist scraping tool for searching my own name on Google, and opening all links in the first 2 pages. 
Since, searching for one's name is kinda shameless, hence the name is inspired from the _shameless scraping of google search results_

### Why?
1. Coz, I can. 
2. Maybe this will make Google think that my name is more important that it is, and put my search results at the top. 
3. Coz, I wanna learn web-scraping, and put it into practice.

### TO-DO:
- [ ] find how to perfrom google search using links
- [ ] find the proper HTML elements to read from the scraper
- [ ] store the links in the DB (SQLite) - maybe make a design of the data to be stored
- [ ] code the actual program
- [ ] deploy in scrapinghub
- [ ] deploy in heroku
- [ ] refactor & make it more generic (planning needed)
